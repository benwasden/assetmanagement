## Asset Management Program

# Overview

This is a simple asset management system meant for IT teams to help manage their devices and keep track of where they are. Records can be looked up by owner to see all devices assigned to someone, or by asset tag to see all the information about a particular device. You can also add an asset, edit, or delete assets from the system. The information is saved to a csv file for easy import/export. If a file isn't found or doesn't have the correct format, the program creates the file for the user.

I primarily made this to help get myself familiar with C# again. I've largely been working with JS/TS for the last year so I needed to get back into practice with other languages before moving on to C++ and others. I had also never set up a C# development environment from scratch, so I wanted to understand how to do that.

# Development Environment

VSCode

C# and no libraries.

# Useful Websites

- [Microsoft C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)
- [VSCode C# Get Started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/csharp/get-started)
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)

StackOverflow was particularly helpful for manipulating CSV files within C# - something I've done in python and JS multiple times but never before in this language.

# Future Work

- Item 1: Implement C# libraries to manipulate CSV files more elegantly.
- Item 2: Make better use of Polymorphism, especially with minifying the add/edit classes.
- Item 3: Use a GUI to make operating the system more user-friendly.
